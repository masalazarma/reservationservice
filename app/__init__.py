    # The session.remove() perform these calls in order:
    # 1. Session.close() on the current Session:
    #  - release any connection/transactional resources owned by the Session first
    #  - discard the Session itself
    #
    # Release a connection means:
    # - that connections are returned to their connection pool
    # - any transactional state is rolled back
    #
    # This prevents error such as:
    # - (sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError) Can't reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back
